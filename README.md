# mqttMultiFunctionButton
This is a multifunction button that will send out mqtt messages. What you do with those messages is on you. 
I built this for use in a footpedal button to turn on an XLights light show when not running as well as 
turn on the speakers when double clicked.

## How to
1. Input your internet and MQTT broker information
2. Connect your button to Pin 2. On a nodeMCU this is D4

### Steps to connect the foot pedal
If you are using the foot pedal I used https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EF9D2DY/
1. Use a NodeMCU
2. Connect D4 to NO
3. Connect COM to Ground
4. Profit

## Current Functionality
1. Single Click
2. Double Click
